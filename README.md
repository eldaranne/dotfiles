# Cloning
Clone the repo recursively because it depends on submodules:
>git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/eldaranne/dotfiles.git

# Install
Everything is installed by running this script from the dotfiles repo root:
>./setup.sh
Just logout and log back in for zsh to be active and log into the i3 user.
